<b>HolidayBot98</b> is a Discord responsive bot made to randomly generate a holiday scene with a random activity, location, and person.

Code documentation should explain pretty much everything as it is relatively simple at this stage.
Otherwise read the [Discord Python documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), more specifically the [event reference section](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#event-reference)
